## Sample APP
Builded a responsive form. The form has a Name, EMail and Message field.
The labels should be next to the inputs on a big screen and above on a small screen (<= 600px).

When the user submits the form, sending of the data should be simulated with a timeout. While sending a loading indicator should be shown and all inputs must not be accessible.

Added test that checks if the form submits its data when the submit button gets clicked.
